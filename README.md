# Android Clean Network Layer üöÄ

This repository provides a robust and clean network layer implementation for Android applications, designed with modularity, testability, and maintainability in mind. It avoids third-party HTTP libraries, relying purely on `HttpURLConnection` for core network operations.

---

## üì¶ Packaging

This repository is source-first. You can integrate it into your project by copying the `lib` module directly into your project's `app/src/main/java/` directory or by packaging it as an AAR (Android Archive) and including it as a dependency.

---

## ‚ú® Features

* **No third-party HTTP libs:** Built entirely using pure `HttpURLConnection` for core networking.
* **Producer‚ÄìConsumer queue (bounded):** Prevents Out Of Memory (OOM) errors under heavy load by limiting concurrent requests.
* **Cancellation:** Every network call returns a `RequestHandle` allowing you to cancel ongoing requests with `.cancel()`.
* **Per-request timeouts:** Override global connect/read timeouts for specific requests when needed.
* **Retry & backoff:** Implements automatic retry with exponential backoff for idempotent methods (GET, PUT, DELETE) on `IOException`, HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests ‚Äì honoring `Retry-After` header), and 503 (Service Unavailable) responses.
* **Gzip support:** Automatically handles compressed responses (Content-Encoding: gzip) for both success and error streams.
* **PATCH compatibility:** Includes a reflection-based fallback for `PATCH` method support on older Android versions that might not natively support it.
* **Typed responses:** Responses are encapsulated in a `NetResult<T>` sealed class, providing clear `Success` and `Error` branches for easy handling.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1) Initialize (Optional Singleton)

You can initialize `NetworkManager` as a singleton within your `Application` class:

```java
public class MyApplication extends Application {
    private static MyApplication instance;
    private NetworkManager network;

    @Override public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();
        instance = this;
        // Replace with your actual base URL
        network = NetworkManager.create("[https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com)"); 
    }

    public static NetworkManager network() { 
        return instance.network; 
    }
}
Or, create an ad-hoc instance wherever needed:

Java

NetworkManager api = NetworkManager.create("[https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com)");
2) Make Requests
Ensure you have your data models (e.g., Todo class) defined in your model package.

GET Request
Java

// Assuming 'api' is an instance of NetworkManager or ABaseApi subclass
api.get("/todos/1", /* queryParams */ null, /* headers */ null, Todo.class,
    new NetworkCallback<Todo>() {
        @Override 
        public void onResult(NetResult<Todo> result) {
            if (result.isSuccess()) {
                Todo data = result.Data(); // Use .Data() as per NetResult class
                Log.d("API", "Title: " + data.title);
            } else {
                Log.e("API", "Error: " + result.getErrorBody() + " Code: " + result.getResponseCode());
            }
        }
    });
Cancelable GET Request
Java

RequestHandle handle = api.get("/todos/1", null, null, Todo.class,
    new NetworkCallback<Todo>() {
        @Override 
        public void onResult(NetResult<Todo> result) { 
            /* Handle result */ 
        }
    });

// ...later in your app logic
handle.cancel(); // Cancel the ongoing request
POST Request (Body as JSON String)
Java

String body = new org.json.JSONObject()
        .put("title", "Android Network Layer")
        .put("completed", false)
        .toString();

api.post("/todos", body, /* headers */ null, Todo.class,
    new NetworkCallback<Todo>() {
        @Override 
        public void onResult(NetResult<Todo> result) {
            if (result.isSuccess()) {
                Log.d("API", "Created todo with id: " + result.Data().id);
            } else {
                Log.e("API", "Error creating todo: " + result.getErrorBody());
            }
        }
    });
PUT / PATCH / DELETE Requests
Java

// PUT Request
api.put("/todos/1", body, /* headers */ null, Todo.class, new NetworkCallback<Todo>()  { 
    @Override 
    public void onResult(NetResult<Todo> r) { /* Handle result */ }
});

// PATCH Request
api.patch("/todos/1", body, /* headers */ null, Todo.class, new NetworkCallback<Todo>() { 
    @Override 
    public void onResult(NetResult<Todo> r) { /* Handle result */ }
});

// DELETE Request
api.delete("/todos/1", /* headers */ null, String.class, new NetworkCallback<String>() { 
    @Override 
    public void onResult(NetResult<String> r) { /* Handle result */ }
});
üö¶ Error Handling
Every network callback receives a NetResult<T> object, which is a sealed class representing either a success or an error:

result.isSuccess() / result.isError(): Check the status of the request.

result.Data(): Access the parsed data on success.

result.getException(): Get the underlying exception on error.

result.getResponseCode(): Get the HTTP status code on error.

result.getErrorBody(): Get the raw error response body (if available) on error.

If the request queue is full, enqueueRequest returns an immediate NetResult.Error with a 429 status code (e.g., "Queue full / 429").

‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
Default network settings are defined in the NetworkConfig class. These can be easily adjusted to suit your application's needs.

Setting	Purpose
QUEUE_CAPACITY	Bounded queue size to prevent memory pressure.
THREAD_POOL_SIZE	Number of worker threads to process requests concurrently.
CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MS	Default connection timeout in milliseconds; can be overridden per request.
READ_TIMEOUT_MS	Default read timeout in milliseconds; can be overridden per request.
RETRY_LIMIT	Maximum number of retries for idempotent requests.
INITIAL_RETRY_DELAY_MS	Initial delay before the first retry (exponential backoff). Honors Retry-After HTTP header.
